> Hulo is a modern, batch-oriented programming language that compiles to Bash, PowerShell, and VBScript. It is designed to unify scripting across platforms with a clean and consistent DSL.

## üì¶ Install

## üöÄ Usage

```hulo
// hello.hl

echo "Hello, World!"
```

Run `hulo build hello.hl`, and it will compile into:
* `hello.sh` for Unix-like systems
* `hello.ps1` for Windows
* `hello.vbs` if VBScript output is enabled
* And more targets in future releases!
